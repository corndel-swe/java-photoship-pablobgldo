## Backlog

### Improve file output naming

The output is always `"output.jpg"` but it would be good if it were
`"cat-output.jpg"` or something. This way, if someone is working with another
image, say `"dog.jpg"`, then the output would be `"dog-output.jpg"` and it won't
overwrite the cat output.

Can you have a go at figuring this out? I think you need to look in
`lib/Converter.java`. Thanks!

### Feedback in terminal

When an image is modified and the output is saved, it would be great if a
message was logged in the terminal so the user knows where to find it. Maybe
something like `"Great! Output is saved in img/cat-output.jpg"`?

You probably need to take a look at `lib/Converter.java` to find out where to
put this.

### Additional features

Are there any more filters we could add to `Pixels.java`? Maybe do some research
or just play around with returning different `rgb` arrays to see what you can
do.

If you look at `App.java` you can copy the pattern for adding a new filter to
the app.
